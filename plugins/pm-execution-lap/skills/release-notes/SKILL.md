    # Release Notes

    ## Purpose
    Write user-facing release notes from tickets, PRDs, changelogs, or shipped features.

    ## Use this when
    - release comms
- changelog
- launch update

    ## Outputs
    - release notes
- audience variants
- risk notes

    ## Operating mode
    1. Restate the PM situation in one sentence.
    2. Identify the artifact, decision, risk, or learning goal the user actually needs.
    3. Ask only for missing information that materially changes the answer; otherwise proceed with labeled assumptions.
    4. Apply the framework with concise reasoning before the artifact.
    5. Produce a PM-ready artifact with clear sections, tables where useful, and decision-oriented next steps.
    6. End with one recommended next skill or workflow.

    ## Gold-standard behavior
    - Prefer evidence over opinion. If evidence is absent, state assumptions explicitly.
    - Separate facts, hypotheses, recommendations, risks, and open questions.
    - Teach briefly while doing the work: explain why the framework fits and how the user can reuse it.
    - Be specific to the product, user, segment, market, or business model in the prompt.
    - Use concise PM language suitable for a product review, discovery readout, PRD, roadmap meeting, or exec discussion.
    - When output is substantial, format it as a Markdown artifact that can be saved directly.

    ## Gold-standard release notes
Write customer-facing notes in plain language. Include what changed, why it matters, who gets it, how to use it, limitations, migration impact, and support path.

    ## Quality gates
    Before finalizing, check:
    - Is the output tied to a user problem or business decision?
    - Are assumptions and evidence clearly labeled?
    - Are tradeoffs visible?
    - Would a PM, designer, engineer, or stakeholder know what to do next?
    - Is the recommendation specific enough to execute or validate?

    ## Anti-patterns
    - Generic PM advice with no artifact.
    - Over-asking for context when a best-effort artifact is possible.
    - Inventing evidence, metrics, personas, or customer quotes.
    - Confusing outputs, outcomes, and activities.
    - Hiding uncertainty instead of making it actionable.
